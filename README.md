## Description
The goal of this webpage is to create a password generator that will generate a random password of a given length and using only character types specified by the user.

## Usage
This webpage can be used by anyone needing to generate a string of random numbers, letters, and/or special characters.

## What I did
Given the HTML and CSS, I wrote the JavaScript to prompt the user to input the desired length of their password and what types of characters it would use. I also wrote JavaScript to generate a random password using the input data from the user.

## What I learned
I learned about implementing for loops and while loops, as well as more about how to understand the logic used in JavaScript. I also learned more about how to implement user prompts and functions into my code.
